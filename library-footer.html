    Ideally would include files more explicitly (as they were),
    instead of including the pkgd.js files.

    matches-selector, ev-emitter, and fizzy-ui-utils are currently
    included twice (infinite-scroll.pkgd.js and isotope.pkgd.js)
    I couldn't get Isotope working correctly without including the pkgd, though

    mediaelement-and-player.js contains dependency 'global'
    infinite-scroll.pkgd.js contains dependencies ev-emitter and fizzy-ui-utils
    imagesloaded.pkgd.js contains dependencies EventEmitter and eventie
    isotope.pkgd.js contains dependencies matches-selector, fizzy-ui-utils,
      get-size, ev-emitter, outlayer, masonry-layout
